# Sorting-Machine

This program takes users input strings and sorts them. The user can enter up to ten strings; the code can also be run with less than that amount by entering "done."
The user is then asked if they would like to display the strings as are, in aphabetically acending order or alphabetically decending order. When sorting the strings, 
the program uses the quick sort algorithm. 


The file 'wordSorter.java' is the program that does this. The file 'quickSort.java' is an example of a quicksort that I found and modified to create 'wordSorter.java'.
